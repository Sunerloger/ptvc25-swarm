// TODO shouldn't interact with each other but with floor and player (via layers), maxLifetime, pick up on player collision (= destroy and add to player score),
// follows player a bit if player below a certain distance, private member "value" and "color" -> color based on value, models are just spheres
// maybe turn off lighting on them if too performance heavy
